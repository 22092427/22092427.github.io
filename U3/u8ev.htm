<h3>Unit 8 in detail</h3>

<h5>Understanding the Characteristics and uses of mobile apps</h5>
<p>This involved producing a report on two different applications, in two different catagories. production of this report encouraged us to carry out our own research and to delve deeper into what makes a good application, and how apps fulfill their purpose or use.</p>

<h5>Designing a mobile application</h5>
<p> For the design process we were given a scenario by our tutor. In our scenario for the design of the app we were told that the client wanted a design for an application that aimed to teach children between the ages of 3 and 7 about the alphabet. Some of the design process can be viewed by clicking the link on this page where you will see a more detailed look at storyboards, structure diagrams, asset logs and test plans.<p>

<h5>Develop test and review of the mobile app</h5>  
<p>For the third assignment it came to developing the application which was done using MIT App Inventor. This was a fun process and you can check out the finished application by using the link on this page to download the APK file for installation on to your mobile device. Once I had intially finshed the app I then set about testing it to ensure that the app and all of its functions worked and performed as I intended, following this, some fine tuning was implemented into the app to create what I believe is a well rounded finished product. Finally I set about reviewing my finshed application, this allowed me to be critical of the processs and final product. This also enabled me to come up with ideas and suggestions for improvements that I could make to the app in the future.</p>

<h3>APK link to The Alphabet App</h3>
<p> Just below this there is an APK link so that you can download the application that I designed and developed for unit 8. Clicking the image or link below will open a New tab where you will be prompted to download the file on to your computer, ready for installation onto your mobile device. <br><br> <a href="apks/U8_A3_TJB_AlphabetApp.apk" target="_blank">APK Link for Unit 8 Application. </a><br><br>
